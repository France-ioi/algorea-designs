First, we list for each type of notification, how the user should be notified: by email, by SMS, on the desktop, and how often. See the list above.

Then, we list all the discussion threads the user currently follows. Users have the option, when they are looking at a discussion thread, to mark it as “to follow”. The discussions they created are automatically marked as “to follow”, and can’t be unfollowed other than by closing them.

*[**TODO**: add list of groups that are being followed.]*
*[To decide: where do we indicate that we start following a group?]*
