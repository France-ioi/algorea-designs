We have a few drop down lists outside of forms, that have a different style.

Other than the color, there should be only one style, so we take the top one, used for the language selection.

TODO design: what if we need a scrollbar?

At the bottom, we show the design to select a different group when in full screen. Not sure if we can see it as a special case of the drop down component.
