Entering a string in the search area and validating displays the results.

The results for each type (skills/activities/groups) are displayed in the corresponding tab. For each tab, the number of search results is displayed in a small circle.

The user may click on any of these items, to load the corresponding page.

When results are displayed, the search bar changes color (orange), and an X appears on the right of the search field. Clicking on it cancels the search.

A button on the right of the search bar gives access to advanced search.
