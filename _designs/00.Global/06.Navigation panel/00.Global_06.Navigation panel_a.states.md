We show an overview of the different states the navigation panel can be in.

Top row, from left to right:
- when not logged in, a connection button is displayed, and the language selection is available
- the skills tab is selected, a tree view of skills is displayed
- the activity tab is selected, a tree view of activities is displayed. At the botom, we show a notification
- the group point of view area is activated

Bottom row, from left to right:

- basic search
- advanced search
- access to special page with nothing in the navigation panel
- profile page, with access to certificates
- manual grading of an activity
- rating of an activity

At any time, there is always a skill or an activity that is selected, and potentially a group.

When groups are opened, the skills and activities tabs move down a bit (potentially all the way to the bottom of the window), to leave enough space for the content of groups. This mean they will move up and down as we open/close group folders, but will always be at least visible at the bottom of the page.

When we click on skills or activities tabs again, they move back up and only the currently selected group is shown.

The profile, advanced search, manual grading, rating of an activity, are presented as temporary states that we just “exit” from to go back to the main tabs
