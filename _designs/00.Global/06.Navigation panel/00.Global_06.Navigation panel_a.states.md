The navigation panel can be in 5 main states, depending on what is currently selected:
- Skills (click on skills tab)
- Activities (click on activities tab)
- Groups (click on current group) 
- Personal profile (click on the login)
- Search results (type some search terms and enter)

At any time, there is always a skill or an activity that is selected, and potentially a group.

When groups are opened, the skills and activities tabs move down a bit (potentially all the way to the bottom of the window), to leave enough space for the content of groups. This mean they will move up and down as we open/close group folders, but will always be at least visible at the bottom of the page.

When we click on skills or activities tabs again, they move back up and only the currently selected group is shown.

The profile and search results are presented as temporary states that we just “exit” from to go back to the main tabs
