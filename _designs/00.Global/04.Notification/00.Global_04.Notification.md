This page lists all current notifications.

Requests or invitations to group are listed until they are accepted or rejected, and always included in the number of notifications displayed on the bell.

Accepted requests/invitations and notifications about discussions are displayed for X days, but only counted in the number of recent notifications until they are viewed on this page for at least X seconds.

Clicking on the eye icon on the right of a given row brings the user to the corresponding page.

[To decide: Do we let users manually mark notifications as viewed?]
