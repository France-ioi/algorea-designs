Notifications can be generated when some specific events happen, in different categories:

Groups:
- Someone requests to join a group the user manages
- Someone invites the user to join a group
- A request by the user to join a group has been accepted

Discussions:
- An answer has been given to a question the user asked.
- A message has been added to a discussion the user follows

Someone in a group the user follows:
- created a discussion in the forum
- solved a task
- submitted a peer-graded answer
- submitted a teacher-graded answer

Other
- Grade obtained from a peer or a teacher

If an event causing a notification just happened (less than a minute ago?), the notification itself is displayed in the navigation tab, just below userâ€™s login.

Clicking on the bell opens a page with all the notifications sorted by date.

Clicking on a notification brings the user to the page the notification is related to (group or discussion).
