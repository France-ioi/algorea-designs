This is a specific component to select an attempt out of a list of recent attempt.

A scroll bar may be needed, or a "show more" button, if there are many attempts.

Do we make this into something a bit more generic? It's a bit similar to the [grading demands](00.Global_11.Specific_components_n_grading_demands) component.
