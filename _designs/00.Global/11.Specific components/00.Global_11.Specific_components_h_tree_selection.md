This is the dialog that appears when clicking on the tree icon of an item selection tool, among possibly other places.

The tree is dynamic: folders can be opened by clicking on them, and their content is loaded on demand.

We preload the content of closed folders. When these folders are opened, we preload the content of their children that are folders.

The user can select one item.
