Here are the different types of fields we typically have in forms, listed in the same order as the left column of the image:
- text input field
- number input field
- drop-down selection list
- boolean switch
- duration input (just a number field with "min" to the right
- date picker with optional "Now" (when empty) and "Never" (to empty) buttons
- date and time picker
- horizontal switch between several choices
- text area
- selection of an item using autocompletion, or clicking on the button to open a (tree dialog)[00.Global_11.Specific_components_h_tree_selection]
- horizontal centered switch between several choices, without a label
- horizontal switch between two possibilities
- selection of a subset of items
- organizing items into 3 categories (very similar)
- selection of a subset of items from a list
- area to type or paste a list of usernames, including search with autocompletion. Design to change, should work like gmail to: field
- score circle editor (change the value by clicking on the circle or editing the number directly
- stars based rating field (1 to 5)
- interval of values using a slider

In the right column, we show:
- larger input fields without a label
- a list of switches (can be ignored for now)
- examples of switches with 3 choices
- as an option: larger text area that takes the whole width of the form
- old version of the tree selection (can be ignored)
