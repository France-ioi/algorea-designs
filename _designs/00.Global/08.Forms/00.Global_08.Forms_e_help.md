To help users fill the form, different informations may be available:

- some text at the top of a section
- information bubbles that may be closed (optional)
- (?) icon at the end of a field, that opens some explanation (TODO: design)
- alternate version of the icon (ignore for now, probaby obsolete)
- some text above a field
- some text below the field, occupying the whole width
- some text above the field, on the right side
- some text below the field label, occupying the left side only
