The UI contains a number of forms, which should have a common look and should be easy to implement using a set of reusable components.

Forms are divided into (sections and subsections)[00.Global_08.Forms_c_sections], each with a set of (fields)[00.Global_08.Forms_d_fields_types]. There may also be read-only data displayed within the forms, or (other types of fields)[00.Global_08.Forms_g_non_fields]. Some fields may be (optional)[00.Global_08.Forms_f_optional_field], others (required)[00.Global_08.Forms_n_mandatory_fields], and different type of (help)[00.Global_08.Forms_e_help] may be provided.

Some fields may have (subfields)[https://france-ioi.github.io/algorea-designs/00.Global_08.Forms_o_subfields].

Forms may display (errors)[00.Global_08.Forms_i_errors] when some provided input is invalid.

Some sections of the form may initially be (locked)[00.Global_08.Forms_p_locked_sections] and made available only when some other fields are already filled.

There are several types of (buttons)[00.Global_08.Forms_h_footer_validation] to validate or cancel the form.

When the label is too long, it should automatically be split into (multiple lines)[00.Global_08.Forms_m_multi_line_labels]

A form may contain other interactive aspects, such as (action buttons)[00.Global_08.Forms_l_action_buttons]
