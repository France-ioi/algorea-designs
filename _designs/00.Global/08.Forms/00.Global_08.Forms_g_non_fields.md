A form may contain some fields that are not input fields.

- fields that contain a readonly value, that may depend on the value provided for other fields.
- optional fields with a generated value, such as a password
- fields that contain a multi-line readonly value
- fields that contain an interactive interface with buttons

Some of these fields may only have values once the object the form is editing has actually been created on the server. Some values are computer client-side when the content of the form changes, or computer server-side when specific actions are done by the user.
