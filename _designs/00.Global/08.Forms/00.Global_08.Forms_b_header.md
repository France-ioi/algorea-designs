Forms will be integrated in different types of containers.

- modal dialogs that can be closed with a X at the top-right corner
- inside tabs of the main page
- inside the main page when switched to "edition mode" with a special header at the top to close or validate.
- within the navigation panel

The components should adapt to the available width, and support different (backgrounds)[00.Global_08.Forms_k_backgrounds] colors (white, gray, black)
