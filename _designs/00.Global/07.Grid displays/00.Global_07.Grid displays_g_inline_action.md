Some actions may be performed directly within the grid.

The 1st design shows an example of confirmation UI that's directly embedded in the row.

The 2nd design shows a case where a specific action is offered for some items. The idea is to bring the attention of the user to this action.

The 3rd design simply shows an edit button. We are not considering inline editing, so this will open a form in a dialog.

The 5th design includes icons that may be clickable inline directly to change their state.

The 6th design just shows a delete icon, that could open an inline confirmation
