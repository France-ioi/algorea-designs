In some cases, the list is editable in the sense that new items may be added.

It could be a simple button to add an item, which opens an edition form.

Or it could give the possibility to create a new content by simply giving its name for now, and leaving the edition of the rest of the fields for later. The possibility to search for an existing item to insert in the list is also offered.
