Many pages of the UI contain grids, with a subset of these features:
- a general selection of the type of information displayed
- a way to select the type of items displayed
- a way to add filters
- a grid header with the names of colums
- the items, including values of different types, and icons
- selecting a subset of the items and apply some actions to them
- applying actions directly inline
- adding items to the list
- pagination: showing more items than initially visible

Each of these features is described on its own page.

Furthermore, a few extra related layouts are presented.
