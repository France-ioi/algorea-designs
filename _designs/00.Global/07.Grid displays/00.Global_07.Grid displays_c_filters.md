Right above the grid, we may have the option to add filters, to only display items that match certain criteria.

Examples of criteria may be:
- a given value or range of value for a certain field
- a substring of one of the fields
- a related item (parent, child, ...)

When filters are available, we have a drop-down list with all the possible types of filters. Once one is selected, a dialog is displayed (TODO: design), to input the details of the filter.

Once validated, the filter is added next to the select box. Clicking on it opens the dialog to change the filter. The X on the right makes it possible to remove it. (Alternate possibility, just have a delete button in the dialog).

For some filters, like the substring search field, we may want to make the filter editable inline.

In some cases, commonly used filters may be already present by default.

The second and third designs are alternate designs. To discuss with the designer if we want to use these.
