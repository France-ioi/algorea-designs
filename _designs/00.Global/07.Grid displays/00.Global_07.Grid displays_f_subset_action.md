A subset of items may be selected, using a special column on the left, where items can be selected using a checkmark.

A link "select all" is also available. It selects all items that are the results of the current filter, even if some are not visible yet.

On the right, a list of possible actions to apply to the select items are available. Clicking on them opens a dialog, which may be a simple confirmation dialog that indicates the number of items on which the action may be performed.

There may be cases where the list of actions doesn't fit in one row => display in a drop-down list?

Two more designs are shown, one where we use checkboxes, and one with a specific button to perform an action on all items => we probably won't use these designs and should update the corresponding pages accordingly.
