The layout consists in 3 sections:

- On the left, collapsible navigation panel
- On the top, the header and tabs
- Under the tabs, the main content


At the top of the header, breadcrumbs represent the current path to the viewed item.

- Below this is content relative to the currently viewed item :
- Current item name + progress
- Item edit button
- Prev/next item

Then usually a set of tabs to select what aspects of the current item to view.

Then most of the page is taken by the content of this tab.

Finally, a footer at the bottom gives access to legal information & other information.
