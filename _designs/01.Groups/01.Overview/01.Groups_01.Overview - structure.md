The overview tab of groups may contain up to five sections:
- a presentation, if the group has one
- a chart showing the progress, relative to the associated activity, or overall activity
- a skills map (to be ignored for now)
- a list of awards of members of the group (public badges?) 
- a list of recently sokved tasks by members of the group (within the associated activity if there is one)
