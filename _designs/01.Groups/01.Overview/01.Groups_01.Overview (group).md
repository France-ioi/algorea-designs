In the header of a group page, similarly to users, several informations are listed:
- the parent group
- the activity it may be attached to (especially if it's a session)
- a website

A button to switch to editing the details of the group is available.

A button to get to the progress visualization pages is displayed. It will open the linked activity, or current activity, but in the mode where this group is being observed.

Other than in the overview tab, we don't show much about the activity of the group itself, since this will be shown on the activity pages when observing this group.

The overview tab contains:
- a presentation
- a 2D map of skills, with the option to make it public.
