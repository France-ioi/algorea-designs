The members tab of the team page lets user manage their team.

For each member, we display, when available and public:
- the username
- the firstName and lastName
- the profile picture
- if they are the creator of the team
- the grade
- when they joined the team

The creator of the team has an X in the top-right corner to remove any member, after confirmation.

The invitation code can be shared with others so that they can join the team.

The bottom area provides a quick way to add a member who is in front of the same computer. It will logout the current user and let another user login, who will then immediately be added to the team.
