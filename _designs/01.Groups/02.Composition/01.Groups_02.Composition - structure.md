When the selected group is not a user, a composition tab is displayed. For teams, it may be called "members". Maybe "Participants" for sessions?

This tab contains:

- a grid with all the subgroups, with:
   - if the group is not a session or team, a type selector to chose what to display: subgroups, sessions, teams or users (TODO: use new design)
   - if there are more than 10 items, filters
   - a column selector (the default displayed columns may depend on the type)
   - a column with an edit icon, enabled when the user has edit access
   - the following actions may be done on selected groups:
      - [print the notice](03.Activities_02.Participation_Dialogs_h.Print), if they are sessions (disabled when types teams and users are selected, or if no session is selected)
      - [export](01.Groups_02.Composition_01.Dialogs_03.Export)
      - merge items, if the user has the right (TODO: design dialog)
      - remove, if the user has the right (TODO: design dialog)
      - [move to another group](01.Groups_02.Composition_01.Dialogs_01.Attach-to-another-group), if the user has the right

- for small groups and if there are images for some of the subgroups, an [alternate mosaic view](01.Groups_02.Composition_p.Team-members) may be used instead of the grid. TODO: we need a switch to force the grid view?

- if the group is empty, the grid is replaced by a [message explaining what to do](01.Groups_02.Composition_h.Empty-group)

Several subsections (TODO: should they really be subsections?):
- If it's not a team or session: a section to pick a type of subgroup to add
- If it's not a team or session: a section to create a session within this group, that will be used to fill the group with users
- a section to define how [members can join this group](01.Groups_02.Composition_d.Invitation-modes) or  [this team](01.Groups_02.Composition_p.Team-members)
- a section to [import users or subgroups from a csv file](01.Groups_02.Composition_01.Dialogs_04.Import)
