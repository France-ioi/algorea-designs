This dialog is used for batch creation of accounts within a group, and potentially each of its subgroups.

These are initially anonymous accounts, and depending on the settings of the platforms, the user may have to provide extra information when he logs in.

Accounts can be created with two types of initial authentication modes:
- password: a username and associated password are created and distributed to the users
- participation code: a simpler (but less secure) participation code, for which no username is required

When genrating accounts, usernames will be generated automatically, starting with a prefix dedicated to the manager, and an extra prefix this manager may add, then followed with a random suffix.

The manager provides:
- the extra prefix
- the length of the suffix
- the length of the associated password
- the numbers of users to create
- whether this number should be created in each of the subgroups of the current group, or simply within the current group itself.
