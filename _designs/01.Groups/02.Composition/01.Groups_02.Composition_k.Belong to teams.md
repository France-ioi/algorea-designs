The team tabs is similar to the groups tab.

A table lists the teams you already belong to. The columns are different, showing you the title, list of members, and what activity the team may be attached to.

You have the possibility to create a team directly, by simply providing a name and clicking +.

Just like for groups, you may join an existing team by providing an invitation code.
TODO: there shouldn't be a search feature for teams. Teams don't support invitations.
