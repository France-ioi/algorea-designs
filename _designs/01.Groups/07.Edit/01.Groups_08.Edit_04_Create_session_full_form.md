This is the session creation form.

Unlike the typical (group creation form)[https://france-ioi.github.io/algorea-designs/01.Groups_Edit_02.Create-group], it's in a modal because we don't want to navigate to the groups.

Maybe we need to rethink this so that it's more consistent.

Other differences: why do we have all the invitations methods when creating a session but not a group?

This form shows some options that are very specific to the Algorea contest: the programming languages and the categories. Maybe these should be grouped in the form, are they are both "options" of the activity.

Associate to the group, basically asks for the parent group of the session. Probably should be renamed "Within the group", or simply "Parent group"

A switch "Attach participants to this group" indicates wether users who take part in this session should automatically be attached as children of the parent group (on top of being attached as children of the session). This is a way to contribute to constituting that group.
