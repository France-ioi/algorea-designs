For groups that the user manage, the members tab makes it possible to view the details of its members and their status.

The first part displays pending requests

*[**TODO**: change title in the design, and add an actual invitations section]*

*[**TODO**: a switch should enable to indicate whether to display requests for all subgroups or just this group directly]*

For each request to join a group, we show (if shared):
- The user login and name
- The userâ€™s grade
- What subgroup is this request for
- The date of the request
- The motivation message
- Controls to reject or accept the request.

A control to accept all visible requests is also available

The next section lists all members of this group. Since there can be a significant number, a search area is available.

If the group has subgroups, the list can be limited to direct members of this group, or all members of the subgroups.

Columns available are the same as for the requests, but the motivation message is not shown by default. A button is available to view all the details, which includes buttons to set the point of view to this user (?), remove him from the group, or edit his personal information.

The participation code of this user is available in the details (if applicable)
