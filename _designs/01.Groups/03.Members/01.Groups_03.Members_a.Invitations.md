4 ways are available to add members to a group:

### 1) Invite users

Giving the login, email address or participation codes of the users to invite.

A search feature makes it possible to search among public information of the user.
*[**TODO**: design the search interface]*

Users will receive a notification of invitation, and may accept or reject it.

### 2) Set an invitation code

Setting an invitation code makes it easy for many users to join the group quickly: generate the code, send it or tell it to the users, and they can just input this code in their groups joined section.

A limited validity duration after the first use may be set. This is mandatory for groups attached to competitions.

### 3) Open the group to joining requests

Activating this makes the name, description, location, date, etc. of the group public and searchable (and potentially visible in the activity if itâ€™s a session attached to an activity). Users may then make requests to join this group.

### 4) Massively create accounts

(see next page)
*[**TODO**: remove question about prefix]*
*[**TODO**: invitation code switch more consistent with other switches?]*
