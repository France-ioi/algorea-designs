The group administration page is where the group owner can define who are the managers of a group, and what they are allowed to do.

This design is obsolete. There aren't "roles" anymore, just a new set of rights, each with multiple settings:
- Can manage:
   - nothing
   - memberships: invite members, accept requests, batch-create users, add/remove subgroups
   - memberships and groups: additionally, may edit the name, description, approvals, managers, add this group as a subgroup of another group.
- Can grant access: may give access to items to the members of this group
- Can watch members: may observe the activity of members of this group
- Can edit personal info: may change the member's personal info and password if the users have approved

Options that are not available for this group because it's not asking the users for this right, should just be grayed, as they are not applicable.

The manager may also add another user to this list.
TODO: dialog to pick the user?
