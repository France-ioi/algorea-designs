When you register an institution, this page lets you search if your institution already exists so that you don't recreate another copy of that institution.

You input data in the search fields, and as you type, search results are displayed on the right. The search results shouldn't be an exact match, but return similar results, so that you may still find it if there is a typo, or other type of difference.

If none of the results are the correct school, the link at the bottom makes it possible to create a new one using the data provided on the left column. If some information is missing, an error will be displayed, otherwise, a simple confirmation popup.
