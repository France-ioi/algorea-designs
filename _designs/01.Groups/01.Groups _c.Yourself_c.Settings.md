This page lets you change various settings about your account:
- display settings, affecting the UI of the platform
   - your current language, overrides your default language obtained from login-module
   - your UI level. basic hides some of the features of the platform (tbd)
   - how chapters should be displayed (should this be presented as an override of the chapter settings?)

- task settings: these are the values set for different options offered by the task. We will let task tell the platform about various options it supports, and once a user visits a task that has a given option available, that option will be added to this list.

- notifications: this is a shortcut to the notifications settings page, that can also be reached by clicking on the bell.
