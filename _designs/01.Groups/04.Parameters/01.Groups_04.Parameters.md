This page is where misc settings for the group are set:

- what activity is this group associated with? It will load that activity when we join the group, or when we try to view the progress of this group.
- should the contest start immediately when we join this group? (grayed if the activity is not in limited time)
- what information about the users and its activity may be visible by members? Users will have to accept mandatory fields before they can join the group.
- what information may other members of the group see about eachother? (change password won't be included)
- what notifications for managers should be automatically generated for this group.
