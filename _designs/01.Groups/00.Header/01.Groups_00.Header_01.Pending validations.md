A group manager may assign activities to the members, that require to be graded manually.

When members have submitted answers to such activities, the list of answers to be graded is available at the top of the groups page, showing how many such answers require to be graded.

Clicking on "View submissions" opens an interface that makes it posssible to loop through all the submissions and grade them one by one. See Activities/Participation/Manual Validation (but the new version should be in the navigation panel)
