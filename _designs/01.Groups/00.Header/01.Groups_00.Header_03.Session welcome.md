When viewing a group of type session:
* If the session was not used, we show a section that suggests to print a notice and reminds how a session is used.

* If the session was used, we should show when

Some work is probably still needed for this page, and aspects specific to sessions.
- the associated activity should be more visible
- the planned date or actual date should be visible, as well as the duration
- the number of planned or available spots vs actual or registered members should be visible
- no subgroups for a session (?) or subsessions to "constitute it"
- clear indication that the session has already been used
- recovery code for a session, like for bebras?
- is the session official or just for testing
- what about the location of the session?
