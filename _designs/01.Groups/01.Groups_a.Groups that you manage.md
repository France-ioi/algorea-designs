The left panel, in the tab for groups / users, has a "groups you manage" section, that lists all the groups the user is a manager of.

Users can be made managers of groups by other users, or they can create their own groups.

Initially, the UI suggests you start by registering what institution you belong to as a teacher or staff member. It also lets you say that you don't belong to any institution in such a position.
