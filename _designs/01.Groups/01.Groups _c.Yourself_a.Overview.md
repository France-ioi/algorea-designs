If you click on "yourself" in the navigation menu, it opens your personal page.

Above the tab, some information about you are displayed:
- Your name
- your school grade or when you graduated
- your personal website
- your country
- a button to access to your certificates
- a switch to make your name public. [TODO: do we really have a setting separate from login-module?]

Below, we find 3 tabs:
- Overview of your activity (see below)
- Personal data shows all the other data obtained from login-module
- Settings let you select your language and other settings for the UI

In the overview tab, we show:
- The presentation text you provided in login-module
- A graph of your progress in terms of the number of activities solved over time
- A 2d view of your skills map, that you can decide to make public
- The list of awards you obtained
- A table showing the tasks you solved recently
