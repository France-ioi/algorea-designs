This is one of two proposals on how to display available sessions for an activity, that the register may want to register for.

Sessions may correspond to an on-site course about the activity, or a time when the activity is opened online, as is typically done for MOOCS. People can register to sessions, but criteria may apply.

Available sessions are displayed below the content of the chapter.

A set of filters can be applied to the list.

For each proposed session, we show:
- The name of the session
- The name of the activity (may be a descendant of the current activity)
- An optional picture (could be the picture of the activity if the session doesn't have its own picture)
- The creator of the session (TODO: it could be another teacher who will animate the session)
- The location (or "online")
- The opening date (what about the duration or end date?)
- The number of registered people
- The number of available spots (if applicable)
- A button to register (named should be changed).

The button to register opens the [Join a group](03.Activities_02.Participation_d.Join-a-group) page.
