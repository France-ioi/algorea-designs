This tab is there to show to the user what activities she can work on to get better at this skill (and the ones she already worked on.)

It starts with a small list of suggested activities. This list will eventually be generated automatically.

The second section displays all activities associated with this skill.

A filter bar makes it possible to:
- Only list the ones the user didn’t already solve, or started.
- Only the ones that are on-site activities, available within a range of dates.
- *[**TODO**: add a filter for the location ?]*
- Switch to only show activities directly attached to this skill, not its sub-skills. *[**TODO**: integrate in design]*
- Display on-site sessions or not.

The results show the suggested activities. For each, the subskill it’s attached to *[**TODO**: add to design]*. The attached on-site sessions are then displayed (potentially filtered).
