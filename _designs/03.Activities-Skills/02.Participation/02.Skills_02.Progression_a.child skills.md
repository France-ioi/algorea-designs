As with the rest of the content, when a user or a group is selected in the group section of the navigation panel, everything that is displayed is about the activity of the user or group that is observed.

If a group is selected, the validation rates displayed are the average validation rate among all the users in that group.

*[**TODO**: For the graph, we could consider a mode where we show the graph of each individual student, with a way to highlight the graph of a specific student (by hovering on the student in the navigation panel, or clicking on one graph)]*

### Group progress by sub-skill

When a group is selected, the progress by subskill is displayed as a 2D view, with skills in one direction, and members of the group in the other. In each cell, the validation rate is displayed as a vertical progress bar.

Several options are available to affect this display:

Displaying sub-groups of the selected group, or directly individual users, regardless of the subgroups.
Displaying just the progress bar and value, or a more detailed view, with the validation date, (or last activity date if not validated), the number of activities solved, the recent tendency, was it certified on site, etc.? *[**TODO**: design of the detailed view]*
Hide users who didn’t start working on this skill yet

*[**TODO**: use colors to differentiate validated skills, and others (or display green check mark / something else when it’s not started)]*

*[**TODO**: show difference between selected time and now, in light orange]*
