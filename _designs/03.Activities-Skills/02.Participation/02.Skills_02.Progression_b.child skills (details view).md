When the detailed view is enable, each cell contains:
- the validation status of the skill
- a vertical progress bar with the current validation rate
- the date of the last time progress was made

Not sure about the others
- the number of activities solved that contributed to this skill?
- the number of prerequisite skills validated?

Clicking on a cell should display the details with legends.

When observing a group or user, a skill may be locked (not represented here). Clicking on the lock may give the user the possibility to make that skill visible for the user.
