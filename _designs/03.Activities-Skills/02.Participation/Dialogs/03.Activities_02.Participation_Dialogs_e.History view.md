Accessing a user’s history on a task, if we are allowed, displays this popup.

It first shows the general information about the status of the user on this task:
- Date of last activity
- Time spent on the task
- Messages on forum
- Number of attempts
- Number of hints
- Validation status / rate

It then displays a list of events in chronological order, including submissions, messages on forum (from this user and people helping him), hints obtained. The current state of the task should also be available.

Clickig on any item in this list should show the content underneath, in an iframe when necessary. We can't have too many iframes opened at the same time, so some should be closed automatically when too many are opened.

The last submission should be visible by default.

Some of this content takes a lot of space, so this dialog should take most of the screen, probably more than is shown on the design. Scrolling the whole page should work if there is a lot to display. We don’t want to scroll within the popup.
