### Skills progression graph

The graph shows the evolution of the skill validation rate over time. Clicking or moving the mouse cursor over the graph displays the date and the validation rate of the skill at that time.

The number displayed in the background is the current validation rate.

### Skills timeline replay

A slider makes it possible to display all the data below as it was at a given time, superimposed to the current rate, so that the progress since that time is visible. [TODO: show this in the design]

Clicking on the “play” button, replays all the changes from this time to the current time.

### Skills progress by chronological order

This view shows all the events that have an impact on that skills validation rate, by chronological order (most recent first): tasks solved, subskill rate improved, prerequisite skill rate improved, etc.

### Skills progress by sub-skills

This view shows the progress for each subskill.
