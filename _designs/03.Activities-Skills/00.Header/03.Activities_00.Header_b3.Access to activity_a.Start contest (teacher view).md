## <span class="color-thread" style="background-color: #aaffaa"></span> Learning about how the contest works
Once the registration steps are done, the user/coordinator is redirected to the pages that explain how the contest works.
He can later come back by clicking on  ~TODO~  
‚Üê [prev](03.Activities_00.Header_a.Landing)

When a user is already registered as a coordinator for an activity, the button "become a coordinator" should be replaced with a tag "coordinator" that indicates that the user already is.

The user may click on the X to indicate that she wants to stop being a coordinator. This means leaving the group and as a consequence, deleting all the sessions attached to this activity, for which she is the last owner.

Clicking on the tag itself (but not the X) takes the user to the particpation tab of the activity, while selecting "groups I manage" with the option to only display the ones that participated in the activity.

The link "you can now create your groups" is probably not needed.

The section "How to coordinate the contest" should not be there. We can just use regular presentaiton content and general contextual help for that.
