Some activities can’t be graded automatically, and are graded by hand,  by the teacher.

When a teacher is observing a user or group for a given activity, he may click on the validation status, to switch to this mode, and show the grading features in the navigation panel.

Missing in the design but present in the (old version)[03.Activities_02.Participation_f.Manual-validation]:

A switch makes it possible to indicate that the activity is now over, so the grade is final.
*[**TODO**: decide the conditions for preventing the teacher to change the grade. For example, a time limit after the grade has been given if the student didn’t change anything. Add as parameters in the item settings when manual validation is activated.]*

When the user can't change the grade anymore, an alert should be displayed. CF (old design)[03.Activities_02.Participation_f.Manual-validation_a.Alert].


A slider then makes it possible to define the grade. The user may also click on the score and edit it. 

We decided against an option to display grades out of 5, 10, 20 instead of 100. Too much confusion.
