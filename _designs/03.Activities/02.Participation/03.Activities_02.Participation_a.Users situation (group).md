The activity progress tab is very similar to the skill progress tab described earlier.


Options for the display of the group activity.
- Display only users who started
- Display detailed views
- Display all users in the groups directly, or just subgroups.



Clicking on a cell shows a bubble with  choices:
- Access to manual validation (if manual navigation is enabled for this activity)
- Access to the details (see below)
- Access to the history of the activity of this user on this task (see below)


*[**TODO**: why not display the details in the bubble? For even more details, open the history]*


*[**TODO**: show progress since selected date in the circle (light orange)]*. Done, but hard at the size...
