This page shows the participation tab on an activity for a single user (including oneself)

The top part is the same as for a group.

The bottom part is similar, without the irrelevant options.

When selecting chronological display, the display is the same as for groups, except that it only shows events for a single user.

When selecting the course display, instead of a 2D table, we have a table with each item of the course, similarly to the Content view, but with more details: number of submissions, number of hints, date of last activity, time spent.

The last 2 icons are access to history and access to the solution.

The current designs shows an expanded design, that shows the task statement of an item. What we probably want is to have an option to display the latest submission. We can't have too many opened at the same time though, so we would need a smart system to ony load them when they should be visible on the scree, or a pagination.
