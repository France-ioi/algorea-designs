The detailed views shows in each cell:
- The validation status/rate
- The date of last activity [relative when recent: 2 days ago, with details in a tooltip]
- The time between when the user started and now or when he validated this activity
- How many messages in the forum
- How many hints
- How many attempts.

Clicking on a cell opens the same bubble as in the compact view, but without the details, since they are already visible.
