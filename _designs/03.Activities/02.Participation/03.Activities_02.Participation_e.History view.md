Accessing a user’s history on a task, if we are allowed, displays this popup.

It first shows the general information about the status of the user on this task:
- Date of last activity
- Time spent on the task
- Messages on forum
- Number of attempts
- Number of hints
- Validation status / rate

It then displays a list of events in chronological order, including submissions, messages on forum (from this user and people helping him), hints obtained. The current state of the task should also be available.

The last submission should be visible by default. Clicking on any submission closes the opened one to open the clicked one. A submission takes most of the screen, so this popup should take most of the screen.

Clicking on a forum message shows the message.

Clicking on a hint shows this hint.

*[**TODO**: make sure scrolling the whole page works. We don’t want to scroll within the popup.]*
*G. That’s the way it was designed indeed, to note for coding.*
