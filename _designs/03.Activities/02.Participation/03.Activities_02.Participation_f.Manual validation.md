Some activities can’t be graded automatically, and are graded by hand,  by the teacher.

When a teacher looks at an activity from the point of view of a group or user, he may click on the validation status, to have this popup appear.

A switch makes it possible to indicate that the activity is now over, so the grade is final.
*[**TODO**: decide the conditions for preventing the teacher to change the grade. For example, a time limit after the grade has been given if the student didn’t change anything. Add as parameters in the item settings when manual validation is activated.]*

A slider then makes it possible to define the grade. The user may also click on the score and edit it. *[**TODO**: make it more obvious that this is possible - form design]*

*[**TODO**: add a comment section, for the teacher to explain the rationale for the grade]*

We decided against an option to display grades out of 5, 10, 20 instead of 100. Too much confusion.
