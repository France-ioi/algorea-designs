This page is very similar to "Access to activity", except that the activity is a contest.

Providing an invitation code is expected to start the pacticipation in the contest immediately, so the label for the invitation code is different: "Start contest"

Furthermore people may be given the option to become a coordinator of this contest. TODO: define when this is activated?

In that case, a button "become coordinator" is added in the top-right corner, if the user is not already registered as a coordinator for this contest. TODO: what defines this in the data?

Under the description, a reminder that the user may create groups is displayed. TODO: shouldn't this be displayed only to users who are already registered as coordinators for this contest?
