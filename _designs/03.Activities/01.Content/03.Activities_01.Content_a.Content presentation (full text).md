We display the validation status using the circle format (see details earlier), to the left of the title.
*[**TODO**: there should be a subtitle?]*
*[**TODO**: what about the type? tags?]*

The following screens focus on chapters, with sub-items. *[**TODO**: add sections about tasks or other content types, to show the tabs and features specific to non-chapter content]*

### Chapter content tab

This is the “standard” view.  if the user is looking at this tab while not observing another group, custom views may be displayed, such as tiles, etc.
*[**TODO**: add designs for alternates view, and how to select them]*

A short description is displayed.

A list of sub-items is then displayed. For each sub-item, we display: its title, subtitle(?), validation status, viewed status(?), item type(?), locked state, key (to unlock other items), maybe more detailed such as number of attempts, hints, forum messages? *[**TODO**: design/specify]*
